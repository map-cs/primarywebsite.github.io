                <p>
                  This project aims to serve the national interest by helping
                  computer science (CS) departments develop or update
                  undergraduate CS majors to meet evolving student needs while
                  balancing international guidelines for CS curricula with local
                  needs and priorities. This Level 1 Institutional and Community
                  Transformation Project includes plans to deploy, test, and
                  revise a structured, facilitated process for faculty at liberal
                  arts institutions to use when reviewing and revising
                  undergraduate CS curricula.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Liberal arts institutions play an important role in educating
                  the nation’s STEM workforce, with roughly a third of CS majors
                  each year graduating from liberal arts and primarily
                  undergraduate institutions. These programs often prioritize
                  opportunities for greater computing literacy across the student
                  body and provide pathways for students to switch into or add CS
                  majors to their degree during their sophomore or junior year,
                  allowing them to recruit students who may not enter college
                  with an intent to study computing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  CS curricula require regular revision to respond to new
                  advances in the discipline, such as generative AI and quantum
                  computing, changing needs of employers, and shifts in the
                  interests, preparation, and career goals of students. The
                  project aims to understand how best to develop faculty capacity
                  for curriculum innovation and encourage CS departments to
                  develop adaptive, effective, mission-aligned curricula that
                  contribute significantly to the development of a broadly
                  prepared computing workforce.

                  Backward design process and expected outcomes
                </h3>

                <p>
                  The project plans to guide departments through a backward
                  design process for curriculum revision in which the distinctive
                  programmatic mission and goals drive the later decision-making
                  about program outcomes, curriculum structure, and selection of
                  core and elective content. This process is grounded in the
                  curriculum design literature and designed to work alongside the
                  latest international curriculum guidelines,
                  <span class="nowrap">CS2023: ACM/IEEE-CS/AAAI Computer Science Curricula.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                  The project aims to show that successful adoption of this
                  process will result in liberal arts CS programs that are <i>(1)
                  prepared and inclined to regularly update their curricula to
                  respond to changes in the discipline and their operating
                  context, (2) equipped to do so effectively and efficiently, and
                  (3) able to do so in a manner that results in distinctive,
                  institutionally aligned, and innovative curricula that respond
                  to advances in the discipline and employer needs.</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Departments will be recruited to participate in facilitated
                  working groups and complete the curriculum review process. Both
                  single-department and cohort-based working group modalities
                  will be tested. The project will study the efficacy of this
                  process through three key measures: curriculum innovation and
                  alignment, faculty engagement and efficacy in curriculum
                  design, and long-term institutional capacity for ongoing
                  program revision.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Evaluation strategies include analysis of revised curricula and
                  associated documentation, participant feedback through surveys
                  and focus groups, and longitudinal data on program change.
                  These investigations will advance understanding of the support
                  needed for successful use of the process and prepare for
                  broader deployment and long-term systemic change.
