          MAP-CS (Mission Aligned Programs for Computer Science) is a research-practice collaboration focused on transforming computer science curriculum design at liberal arts institutions. The project partners faculty, departments, and institutional leaders to develop and study CS programs that are deeply integrated with institutional missions, values, and local community contexts. Through iterative design, implementation, and assessment, MAP-CS aims to build sustainable models for CS pathways that broaden participation and align with liberal arts traditions.
