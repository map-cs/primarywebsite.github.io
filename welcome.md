# Welcome to the MAP‑CS Project

Welcome to the website for the **Mission Aligned Programs for Computer Science (MAP‑CS)** project, supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF Award #2517967).  

Our goal is to understand and document how computer science is integrated into liberal arts institutions, highlighting both common patterns and distinctive approaches across a range of colleges.

Mission Aligned Programs for Computer Science (MAP‑CS) refers to CS programs that are intentionally designed to reflect and advance the core mission of their liberal arts institutions.  

In practice, MAP‑CS programs align curricular structures, learning outcomes, pedagogy, and co‑curricular opportunities with liberal arts values such as breadth of study, critical inquiry, ethical reflection, and attention to context and community.

This site serves as a hub for:

- Project summaries and goals for faculty, administrators, and partners  
- Working materials, process documents, and tools developed under the grant  
- Publications, resources, and links to related SIGCSE and ACM activities  

We invite liberal arts computing faculty, institutional leaders, and collaborators to explore the materials here, adapt them for local use, and share feedback as the project evolves.
