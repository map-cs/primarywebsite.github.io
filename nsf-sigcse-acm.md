## Related Co‑PI Grants

In addition to the primary MAP‑CS award, co‑principal investigators on this project are connected to related NSF‑funded efforts that inform and complement this work, grant is listed under three NSF award numbers.

## SIGCSE and ACM Connections

The MAP‑CS project is closely connected to the broader CS education community, particularly through SIGCSE and ACM.

- Engagement with the **SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges**, including shared interests in how CS fits within liberal arts missions.  
- Contributions to SIGCSE conferences, workshops, and working groups that focus on curricular models, assessment, and institutional change in computing.  
- Alignment with ACM’s curricular guidance, adapted for mission‑aligned liberal arts contexts.

As publications and community presentations associated with MAP‑CS become available, we will list them on the [Publications](supporting-material/publications.md) page and, when appropriate, link them back to the corresponding NSF awards.
